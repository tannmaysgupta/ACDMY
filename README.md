# ACDMY : A virtual place to learn

### ACDMY is a  Mobile Virtual Application that I am building for my final year project

The app tries to incorporate all the good user experience practises from Virtual Reality and tries to rework them with the paradigms of Mobile Virtual Reality. The current stage of Mobile Virtual Reality are very taxing on the graphics and the accessibility of the hardware is limited majorly due to the cost vs usability ratio. Interaction represents an opportunity to create truly immersive and satisfying experiences.
